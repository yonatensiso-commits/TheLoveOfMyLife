        From your Yehonatan.  
        My beautiful princess. My pretty face.  
        The love of my life.  
        I fell in love with you long before I ever saw you in front of me –  
        so I made you a tiny corner of the internet to tell you how much I love you.

    <h3>Our story (so far)</h3>
    <div class="card">
        <p>
            Before I ever met you in real life, you were already in my heart.  
            From our first messages, from every “good morning”, from every stupid joke,  
            I felt myself falling for you more and more – even without seeing you.
        </p>
        <p>
            I remember reading our chats again and again,  
            smiling like an idiot at my screen, thinking,  
            “How can someone I haven’t even met yet make me feel like this?”
        </p>
        <p>
            So when we finally met in person,  
            it didn’t feel like meeting someone new.  
            It felt like I was finally standing in front of the girl  
            I’d already fallen in love with a long time before.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since then it’s been jokes, random conversations,  
            late night talks, stupid memes, looks, smiles –  
            all the little things that slowly became “us”.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every day, I fall a little more in love with you.  
            And honestly, I love that I can call you  
            <strong>my girlfriend</strong>, my beautiful princess,  
            and the love of my life.
        </p>

    <div class="card timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <h4>How it started</h4>
            <p>
                It started with a screen, not with a meeting.  
                With typing, not with touch.  
                With your words, your energy, your voice, your way of being you.  
                By the time I saw you standing in front of me,  
                my heart was already completely yours.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <h4>A moment I’ll never forget</h4>
            <p>
                One of my favorite memories is us just being together,  
                laughing about something stupid, not caring about anything else,  
                and feeling like time stopped for a bit.  
                In those moments I always think:  
                “I love this girl so much. I don’t want this to end.”
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <h4>What I want next</h4>
            <p>
                More time with you.  
                More nights where we forget the time, more hugs that last too long,  
                more moments where I look at you and think  
                “how is this amazing person actually mine?”.  
                I just want a future where I can keep telling you  
                how much I love you, again and again.

            <li>The way you laugh, especially when you try to hold it in and totally fail.</li>

            <li>How you care about people more than you admit, and how big your heart really is.</li>
            <li>Your hugs. They honestly feel like home, like a place I never want to leave.</li>
            <li>The little weird, cute things you do that make you different from everyone else.</li>
            <li>How real and honest you are, even when it’s not the easiest thing.</li>
            <li>The way you can calm me down and make me feel better without even trying.</li>
            <li>Your patience with me, even when I’m being annoying or stubborn.</li>
            <li>Your smile, and how it can fix my whole day in one second.</li>
            <li>
                And most of all – the way you make it so easy for me to love you.  
                I tell you “I love you” a lot, and I mean it every. single. time.

    <h3>A little message for you</h3>
    <div class="card">
        <p>
            Hey Tahel, my beautiful princess, my pretty face,  
            the love of my life,
        </p>
        <p>
            I know I tell you “I love you” a lot.  
            I’ll probably say it today, tomorrow, and the day after that.  
            But I want you to know that every single time I say it,  
            I mean it with my whole heart.
        </p>
        <p>
            I love you when you’re happy,  
            I love you when you’re tired,  
            I love you when you overthink,  
            I love you when you’re loud and when you’re quiet.  
            I just… love you. So, so much.
        </p>
        <p>
            You have no idea how much you changed my days.  
            Your messages, your voice, your hugs, your jokes –  
            all the small things you do without thinking about them  
            actually mean the world to me.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m not going to say everything will always be perfect.  
            But I can say this: I’m here.  
            For the fun days, the bad moods, the tired days, the lazy days,  
            the deep talks, and the stupid ones too.  
            I want to be there for all of it, with you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you for being you.  
            Thank you for letting me be part of your life.  
            I’m so, so lucky to call you mine.  
            And I will never get tired of telling you  
            how much I love you.
